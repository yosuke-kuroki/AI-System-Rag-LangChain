    "YETI primarily designs bags for general outdoor use, such as backpacks, duffels, and tote bags. They do not offer bags specifically tailored for mounting on the racks of recumbent trikes. However, some of their products, like the SideKick Dry Gear Case, feature MOLLE (Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment) compatibility, allowing them to attach to other MOLLE-equipped gear. While this feature is intended for use with YETI coolers and backpacks, it might be adaptable to certain bike rack systems with appropriate modifications. For optimal fit and functionality, it's advisable to consider bags specifically designed for recumbent trikes.
