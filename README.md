# LangChain & RAG System for Portfolio Support in Google Colab

This repository contains a [Google Colab Notebook](RAG_LangChain_AI_System.ipynb) that implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for portfolio support. The system integrates document retrieval, dynamic entity extraction, and external API calls to generate informed, context-aware responses using a Hugging Face language model via Ollama. The entire application runs in Google Colab and is designed to work on both Linux and Windows environments.

In addition to that, this repository also contains a Flask app that serves as an API endpoint for the RAG system. The app allows users to interact with the RAG system via HTTP POST requests, enabling seamless integration with other applications and services.

Additionally, it also includes a sample backend Express API that can be used to interact with the RAG system. The system can (and should) query from the API to get more data to generate better-informed responses.

> Note: The live sample Express API is hosted on Render.com and can be accessed at [https://rag-langchain-ai-system.onrender.com](https://rag-langchain-ai-system.onrender.com). The API provides endpoints for team profiles, investments, sectors, consultations, and more. You can use these endpoints to retrieve data and enrich the responses generated by the RAG system. However, please note that it will spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity, so it may need some time to spin up again if it has been inactive for a while.

## Embedding and Language Models Used

- **Embedding Model:**  
  We use the Hugging Face model `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` to encode text chunks extracted from MasterClass documents. This model generates vector representations that enable fast similarity searches using a FAISS vector store.

- **Language Model:**  
  The system utilizes the Ollama integration with the `llama2` model to generate natural language responses based on the retrieved context and API data.

- **FAISS Vector Store:**  
  The FAISS vector store is used to efficiently retrieve relevant document content based on user queries. The vector store is built from the embedded text chunks using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model.

- **Flask API:**  
  The Flask app serves as an API endpoint for the RAG system, allowing users to interact with the system via HTTP POST requests. The app provides a simple and intuitive interface for querying the RAG system and receiving context-aware responses.

- **External APIs & API Chaining:**  
  The system integrates with external APIs to retrieve additional data related to team profiles, investments, sectors, consultations, and more. These APIs provide valuable insights that enhance the system's responses and support portfolio management activities.

> Note: In this project, the "external APIs" are simulated using a sample backend Express API. The actual APIs can be substituted with real endpoints to access live data of your choice. Visit the [Sample Backend Express API](https://rag-langchain-ai-system.onrender.com) for more details.

## Strategies for Retrieval Accuracy and Persistent Memory

- **Document Processing and Retrieval:**  
  1. The system downloads a ZIP file of MasterClass documents via the `/api/documents/download` endpoint.
  2. It extracts all text files and splits them into manageable chunks using a `CharacterTextSplitter`.
  3. These text chunks are then embedded using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model and stored in an in-memory FAISS vector store, which allows for efficient retrieval of relevant content based on user queries.
  4. When a user query is received, the system retrieves the most relevant document chunks using the FAISS vector store and generates a response based on the retrieved context.
  5. The response is further enriched with data from external APIs to provide comprehensive and accurate information.
  6. The system uses a combination of document retrieval, external API data, and dynamic entity extraction to generate context-aware responses that address user queries effectively.

- **Persistent Memory:**  
  Conversation history is maintained in a global variable (or via session data) so that context is preserved across multiple user queries. This persistent memory enables the system to handle follow-up questions accurately and generate coherent, context-aware responses.

- **Dynamic Entity Extraction:**  
  Regular expressions are used to extract entities (e.g., person names, company names, sectors, URLs) from the user's query or conversation history. Based on keywords such as "consult", "profile", "investment", "sector", or "scrape", the corresponding API endpoint is called. The retrieved data (or friendly messages if no data is found) is then appended to the prompt used to generate the final response.

- **Error Handling and Robustness:**  
  The system includes robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle failures when retrieving documents, querying external APIs, or processing user queries. By implementing try/except blocks and error checks, the system ensures a smooth user experience and provides informative messages in case of errors.

- **API Tool Integration Methodology:**  
  The system integrates with multiple API endpoints, including `/ping`, `/api/documents/download`, `/api/team`, `/api/investments`, `/api/sectors`, `/api/consultations`, and `/api/scrape`. Based on the user query or conversation history, the system dynamically extracts entities and calls the appropriate API endpoint to retrieve relevant data. The retrieved information is then used to generate context-aware responses that address the user's query effectively.

- **API Chaining and Data Enrichment:**  
  The system leverages external APIs to enrich the responses with additional data related to team profiles, investments, sectors, and consultations. By chaining API calls and combining the retrieved data with document context, the system provides comprehensive and up-to-date information to support portfolio management activities.

## API Tool Integration Methodology

- **External API Endpoints:**  
  The system integrates with multiple API endpoints, including:
  - **/ping:** Verifies API credentials.
  - **/api/documents/download:** Downloads MasterClass documents.
  - **/api/team** and **/api/team/insights:** Retrieve team profiles and related insights.
  - **/api/investments** and **/api/investments/insights:** Retrieve investment details.
  - **/api/sectors:** Retrieves information about specific sectors.
  - **/api/consultations:** Retrieves consultation details.
  - **/api/scrape:** Scrapes content from provided URLs.

- **Dynamic Entity Extraction:**  
  Regular expressions are used to extract entities (e.g., person names, company names, sectors, URLs) from the user's query or conversation history. Based on keywords such as "consult", "profile", "investment", "sector", or "scrape", the corresponding API endpoint is called.  
  The retrieved data (or friendly messages if no data is found) is then appended to the prompt used to generate the final response.

- **API Chaining and Data Enrichment:**  
  The system leverages external APIs to enrich the responses with additional data related to team profiles, investments, sectors, and consultations. By chaining API calls and combining the retrieved data with document context, the system provides comprehensive and up-to-date information to support portfolio management activities.

## How to Deploy / Use the Code

### 1. Set Up Your Colab Environment

> **Note:** Please use a Google Colab instance with a GPU (e.g. T4 GPU) for better performance. All code are tested and optimized for Google Colab only!

**a. Install the Colab XTerm extension (for command-line support):**
```python
!pip install colab-xterm
%load_ext colabxterm
```

**b. Launch an XTerm terminal within Colab:**
```python
%xterm
```
This opens a full-screen terminal window within your notebook.

**c. Install and serve Ollama:**

In the XTerm terminal, run:
```bash
curl https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
ollama serve &
```
- The first command installs Ollama.
- The second command starts the Ollama server in the background.  
  *(Tip: Check the `server.log` file for startup messages.)*

**d. Pull an AI Model (Example using `llama2`):**
```bash
ollama pull llama2
```
This downloads the model for use.

**e. Verify the Ollama Installation:**
```python
!ollama -version
```
If you see the version number, your Ollama server is running correctly.

### 2. Install Required Python Packages

Run the following cell in Colab:
```python
!pip install langchain_community faiss-cpu sentence-transformers requests flask pyngrok
```

### 3. Run the RAG Script

Copy the full RAG system script (provided in the notebook) into a new cell and run it. The script will:
1. Download and extract MasterClass documents.
2. Build a FAISS vector store from the document contents.
3. Initialize the Ollama language model.
4. Start an interactive conversation loop where you can type queries.
5. Retrieve relevant document context and external API data to generate responses.

**Note:**  
- Update `API_TOKEN` and `API_BASE_URL` with your credentials.
- Type queries in the interactive loop. Type `exit` or `quit` to end the session.

### 4. Running the Flask App

1. **Set Up ngrok for Colab:**

   - Install pyngrok and Flask if not already installed:
     ```python
     !pip install flask pyngrok
     ```
   - Set your ngrok authtoken (replace `"YOUR_NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN"` with your actual token):
     ```python
     from pyngrok import ngrok
     ngrok.set_auth_token("YOUR_NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN")
     ```

2. **Run the Flask App Cell:**

   Execute the cell containing the Flask app code. Once the documents are loaded and indexed, the app will start on port 5000 and ngrok will create a public tunnel. The output will display a public URL (e.g., `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app`).

3. **Test the Flask Endpoint:**

   Send a POST request to the `/chat` endpoint using the public URL. For example, in a new Colab cell:
   ```bash
   !curl -X POST "https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/chat" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "hello"}'
   ```
   Replace `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app` with the actual URL printed by ngrok.

## Running the Sample Backend Express API

1. **Install Required Packages:**

   Navigate to the `backend` directory and install the required packages:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
   
   Also, don't forget to set up the `.env` file with the following content:
   ```plaintext
    MONGO_URI=<your-mongo-uri>
    PORT=3456
    ```
   
2. **Start the Express Server:**

   Start the Express server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The server will run on `http://localhost:3456`. Visiting it in your browser should show the API documentation in Swagger UI.

3. **Test the API Endpoints:**
  
    You can now test the API endpoints using tools like Postman or cURL. For example:
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:3456/api/team
    ```
   
4. **Integrate with the RAG System:**

   Update the Flask app to query the sample backend API endpoints for additional data. You can modify the `/chat` endpoint in the Flask app to call the sample backend API and enrich the responses with relevant information. Also, feel free to make changes to the API as needed if you want it to return different data or support more operations.

And many more features can be tested interactively in the notebook!

## Why Use Google Colab

Google Colab provides a free, cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment with GPU support, making it an ideal platform for running AI models, training neural networks, and executing complex computations compared to local machines.

Thus, I have elected to use Google Colab for this project to leverage its great GPU capabilities, easy setup, and seamless integration with external APIs and services. 

I have also tested the code so that it works on my MacOS (Local) and Windows (Local) machines, with minor adjustments. However, the performance was quite poor compared to Google Colab, so I recommend using Google Colab for the best experience.
